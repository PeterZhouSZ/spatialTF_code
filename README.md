# A Spatial Target Function for Metropolis Photon Tracing #

This code extends Mitsuba and implements the algorithm presented in the paper "A Spatial Target Function for Metropolis Photon Tracing" by Gruson et al.

The algorithm proposed in this paper is based on Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping (SPPM) with a specific Target Function (TF). This TF is used in Metropolis sampling to distribute the light samples over the image plane to minimize relative error.
